            <p> Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old black student, was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in Sanford, Florida. Martin was walking back from a convenience store when he was confronted by Zimmerman, who claimed
                he looked suspicious. Zimmerman followed Martin despite being told by the police dispatcher not to do so. A struggle ensued and Zimmerman shot Martin in the chest, killing him.</p>

            <p>Martin's death sparked national outrage, leading to widespread protests and the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, which was initially started as a hashtag (#BlackLivesMatter) on social media by activists Alicia Garza, Patrisse
                Cullors, and Opal Tometi. The movement quickly gained momentum, focusing on the issue of police brutality and racially motivated violence against Black people. The protesters demanded justice for Martin and called for Zimmerman's arrest
                and prosecution.</p>
            <p>Zimmerman was eventually charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, but was acquitted by a jury after claiming self-defense under Florid's Stand Your Ground law. The verdict sparked more protests and calls for reform of the law.</p>

            <p>Following the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's murderer, George Zimmerman, activists Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi created the Black Lives Matter hashtag which soon spurred a global movement. The movement grew into a network
                of chapters and organizations across the country and the world, organizing protests, campaigns, events, and programs to address various issues affecting black communities, such as mass incarceration, education, health care, economic justice,
                environmental justice, LGBTQ+ rights, and more. The movement also aimed to affirm the humanity and dignity of black people and challenge the negative stereotypes and narratives that devalue their lives.</p>

            <p>Michael Brown Jr., an 18-year-old black man, was fatally shot by 28-year-old white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the city of Ferguson, Missouri. Brown was unarmed and had his hands up saying "don't shoot" when he was shot multiple
                times by Wilson, who claimed he acted in self-defense. Brown's body was left on the street for four hours before being removed by the authorities.</p>

            <p>Brow's death resulted in several protests and civil unrest in Ferguson, an event known as the Ferguson Uprising. The protests were met with a highly militarized police response, which included tear gas, rubber bullets, armored vehicles, and
                snipers. The protesters chanted “Hands up, don't shoot” and “Black lives matter”, demanding justice for Brown and an end to police brutality. The protests also spread to other cities across the country and the world.</p>
            <p>The grand jury decided not to indict Wilson for Brown's death, sparking more outrage and protests. The U.S. Department of Justice also conducted an investigation and found that Wilson did not violate Brown's civil rights. However, the investigation
                also revealed that the Ferguson Police Department had a pattern of racial bias and discrimination against black residents, leading to several reforms and resignations.</p>

            <p>The protests in response to George Floyd's murder were massive and diverse, involving millions of people in all 50 states and over 60 countries. The protesters demanded justice for Floyd and other victims of police brutality, as well as systemic
                reforms to end racial discrimination and violence. The protesters chanted “Say his name” and “Black lives matter”, as well as “No justice, no peace”. The protests also faced violent repression from the police and federal agents, who used
                tear gas, rubber bullets, batons, and pepper spray against the demonstrators.</p>
            <p>The trial of Derek Chauvin resulted in his conviction of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. He was sentenced to 22.5 years in prison. The other three officers involved in Floyd's arrest were also charged

            <p>Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman, was fatally shot in her Louisville, Kentucky apartment on March 13, 2020, when white plainclothes officers Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison, and Myles Cosgrove of the Louisville Metro Police Department
                (LMPD) forced entry into the apartment as part of an investigation into drug dealing operations. The police used a no-knock warrant in the middle of the night to enter the home, but Taylor's home was the wrong one, resulting in her boyfriend
                (unknowingly) firing at the police resulting in return fire which killed Breonna. Taylor's death led to numerous protests calling for the officers involved to be charged with murder.</p>

                also faced resistance from the police and counter-protesters, who often clashed with the demonstrators. The trial of the officers involved in Taylor's death resulted in only one officer being charged with wanton endangerment for shooting
                into a neighboring apartment. The other two officers were not charged at all. The U.S. Department of Justice also launched a civil rights investigation into the LMPD.</p>

            <p>In the wake of the numerous instances of police violence, many protests began advocating for a "Defund the Police " movement. The term is a slogan that supports divesting funds from police departments and reallocating them to non-policing
                forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resources.</p>
            <p>The movement argues that police reform is not enough to address the systemic racism and violence in law enforcement, and that reducing the role and power of the police is necessary to create safer and more equitable communities. The movement
                also challenges the notion that more policing equals more safety, and points out the disproportionate impact of policing on marginalized groups, such as people of color, low-income people, LGBTQ+ people, people with disabilities, and people
                with mental health issues.</p>

                neighbor William "Roddie" Bryan Jr. — who suspected him of being a burglar. The McMichaels armed themselves with guns and chased Arbery in a pickup truck, while Bryan followed them in another vehicle and recorded the incident on his cellphone.
                The video showed Arbery trying to run past the McMichaels' truck, then being met by Travis McMichael who shot him three times during a struggle.</p>

            <p>The trial of the suspects resulted in them being charged with murder, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. They pleaded not guilty and claimed they acted in self-defense. The U.S. Department

                white police officers — Nathan Woodyard, Jason Rosenblatt, and Randy Roedema — who responded to a call about a “suspicious person” wearing a ski mask. McClain was unarmed and had not committed any crime. He was wearing a ski mask because
                he had anemia and was cold.</p>
            <p>The officers tackled McClain to the ground and put him in a chokehold that restricts blood flow to the brain. McClain pleaded with the officers, saying “I can't breathe”, “I'm an introvert”, and “I'm just different”. He also vomited and apologized
                repeatedly. The paramedics arrived and administered ketamine, a powerful sedative, to McClain without his consent. McClain suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital and was declared brain dead. He died six days later.</p>

            <h2>Black Lives Matter Future</h2> <img src="images/blm-future.jpg" alt="Image for Black Lives Matter Future">
            <p>The Black Lives Matter movement has had a massive impact on the American consciousness and mobilized millions of activists to raise awareness about police reform and racial inequality in the US. The movement effectively leveraged social media
                and television to show the stark reality of violance by the police against black Americans and grow support for a movement most white Americans didn't care about. Moreover, it caused a variety of concrete changes like:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Several states and cities enacted laws and policies to reform their police departments, such as banning chokeholds, limiting use-of-force, increasing transparency and accountability, diverting funds to social services, and creating civilian
                    review boards.</li>
                <li>Corporations and organizations supported racial equity and diversity initiatives, such as donating money to social justice causes, hiring more people of color, creating anti-racism programs, and promoting Black-owned businesses.</li>
                <li>Celebrities and influencers used their platforms to raise awareness and funds for the Black Lives Matter movement and other related causes, by donating money, participating in protests, speaking out against racism, and amplifying black
                    voices.
                </li>
                <li>Media outlets and platforms increased their coverage and representation of Black stories and perspectives by featuring more black journalists, authors, artists, and creators, highlighting black history and culture, and addressing racial
                    issues and biases.</li>
                <li>Educational institutions and educators incorporated more Black history and culture into their curricula and classrooms, as well as addressed racial disparities and discrimination in their policies and practices.</li>
                <li>Sports leagues and athletes expressed their solidarity and support for the Black Lives Matter movement and other related causes, through wearing shirts and masks with messages, kneeling during the national anthem, boycotting games, and
                    speaking out against racism.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite some progress, The Black Lives Matter movement's work is obviously not over. Federally, and across many states and cities, police reform failed to pass, so there is clearly a lot of work to do to achieve its goals and vision of a world
                where black lives are equally valued and respected.</p>
